Technical Implementation:
=========================

✓ Design System Applied:
  - Primary Yellow: #F5C518 (all actions, buttons, selections)
  - Soft Grey: #6B7280 (borders, secondary elements)
  - Light Grey: #F9FAFB (backgrounds for depth)
  - White: Main backgrounds
  - Red: #EF4444 (errors only)

✓ Agent Integration:
  - Manager Agent ID: 69859abce17e33c11eed1ad0 (Design Orchestrator)
  - Uses aiAgent.ts for ALL agent calls
  - Proper JSON parsing with parseAgentResponse()
  - Response schema: status, result.data.nodes, result.data.connections
  - Inline error feedback (no toasts)

✓ Features Implemented:
  - Interactive node-based canvas with drag/drop
  - Real-time node editing with side panel
  - Component library with 5 draggable templates (API Gateway, Database, Cache, Queue, Service)
  - Multi-format export (JSON working, PNG/SVG/PDF placeholder)
  - Project versioning structure
  - Adaptive documentation depth based on audience selection
  - Yellow pulsing loader during generation
  - Inline error feedback
  - Responsive layout with collapsible sidebars
  - Local storage persistence (ProjectStorage)

✓ Complete User Journey:
  Dashboard → New Project → Design Canvas opens → Type project name →
  Enter requirements → Select audience → Click "Generate System Design" →
  Yellow pulsing loader → Nodes appear on canvas → Click node →
  Right panel slides in → Edit properties → Apply Changes →
  Drag template from library → Connect nodes → Export → Save → Dashboard

✓ Files Created:
  - /lib/types.ts - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
  - /lib/utils.ts - Utility functions (ProjectStorage, templates, canvas utils)
  - /app/page.tsx - Dashboard with project grid
  - /app/project/[id]/page.tsx - Full Design Canvas implementation

✓ Libraries Used:
  - react-icons (FaServer, FaDatabase, FaBolt, FaStream, FaCube, etc.)
  - shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Select, Accordion, Tabs, Dialog, etc.)
  - Tailwind CSS for all styling
  - Next.js 14+ App Router
  - TypeScript with proper interfaces

Notes:
======
- NO EMOJIS used (per PRD requirement)
- NO TOAST/SONNER (inline feedback only)
- NO SIGN IN/OAUTH (agent handles auth)
- All colors match EXACT specifications from PRD
- Agent integration uses existing aiAgent.ts utility
- Canvas implementation is custom (no external library needed)
- Export to PNG/SVG/PDF would require html2canvas (not installed)
- JSON export fully functional
- All state managed locally (no external state library)
